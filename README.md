# flowcardLib
Ergo FlowCard library for diagrams.net

## Details
This library can be imported into your diagrams.net project and used for designing smart contracts visually for the Ergo Platform. Simply modify the components to fit your needs.

It should help you to convert sketches into diagrams for good documentation, prototype quickly, and make sure your logic makes sense before you write any code. 

In the future, a standalone tool could be developed by someone else to generate FlowCards into ErgoScript code directly; I don't know how to do that :/

In order to use this library properly, you **must** follow the framework described in [**this**](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_29_flow_cards/) Ergo Platform blog post. By doing so, you will be able to write your ErgoScript logic by reading and following the logic of the FlowCard.

There are two ways to use the library.
  - IMPORT URL: Copy/paste the URL to manually import the library from within a project. 
  - BYPASS URL: Open URL to automatically create a new project with the library already imported.

I hope this is useful. If there are any issues, please let me know and send me an [email](ldgaetano@protonmail.com).
