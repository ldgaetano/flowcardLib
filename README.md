# flowcardLib
Ergo FlowCard library for diagrams.net

## Details
This library can be imported into your diagrams.net project and used for designing smart contracts visually for the Ergo Platform. Simply modify the components to fit your needs.

It should help you to convert sketches into diagrams for good documentation, prototype quickly, and make sure your logic makes sense before you write any code. 

In order to use this library properly, you **must** follow the framework described in [**this**](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_29_flow_cards/) Ergo Platform blog post. By doing so, you will be able to write your ErgoScript by reading and following the logic of the FlowCard you created.

## Importing
Instructions on how to import a library into diagrams.net can be found [here](https://www.diagrams.net/blog/custom-libraries).

Copy/paste the `IMPORT URL` to manually import the library from within a diagrams.net project.

IMPORT URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucagdangelo/flowcardLib/main/ergo-flowcardLib-1.0.xml`

## Notes
New versions will be added if more components want to be added. The `IMPORT URL` provided will be for the most recent version. Older URL versions will still function since files will be located in the same location within the repository.

I hope this is useful. If there are any issues, or you would like me to add more components, then please let me know by creating a GitHub issue or sending me an [email](ldgaetano@protonmail.com).
