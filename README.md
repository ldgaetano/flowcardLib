# flowcardLib
Ergo FlowCard library for diagrams.net

## Details
This library can be imported into your diagrams.net project and used for designing smart contracts visually for the Ergo Platform. Simply modify the components to fit your needs.

It should help you with prototyping different smart contract ideas visually, converting sketches into diagrams for good documentation, and making sure your logic makes sense before you write any code. 

In order to use this library properly, you **must** follow the framework described in [**this**](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020_04_29_flow_cards/) Ergo Platform blog post. By doing so, you will be able to write your ErgoScript by reading and following the logic of the FlowCard you created.

## Importing
Instructions on how to import a library into diagrams.net can be found [here](https://www.diagrams.net/blog/custom-libraries).

**Copy/paste** the `IMPORT URL` below into your diagrams.net project to manually import the library:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucagdangelo/flowcardLib/main/ergo-flowcardLib-1.0.0.xml`

## Notes
The `IMPORT URL` provided is for the most recent version. New versions will be created when more components want to be added. Older URL versions will still function since files will be located in the same location within the repository.

I hope this is useful. If there are any issues, or you would like me to add more components, then please let me know by creating a GitHub issue or sending me an [email](ldgaetano@protonmail.com).
